# Demo

The output files in this directory have been generated by processing one PST file from the EDRM Enron Email
Data Set (see attribution below).

The output files in each of the `001/` directories have been truncated from 1,171 to 9.

**Note on extracted data:**
This code's only purpose was to extract and process data for building the [Avocado Research Email
Collection](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2015t03). It has not been systematically tested on
other PST data sets. The extracted data in this demo has not been verified to be correct and/or complete.
Its only purpose is a demonstration of the generated format and file structure.

## What's inside

The `input` directory contains one PST file that was used as a source (see attribution below).

The `output` directory contains the files generated by 2 distro builders: 

- *builder-1* uses XML `<xi:include>` directives in `collection.xml` (list of custodians) and `001.xml`
  (custodian metadata). Item metadata is located in individual xml files in the custodian directory
  (`001/`).
- *builder-2*  uses XML `<xi:include>` directives in `collection.xml` only; as a result  the `001.xml`
  file is quite large (3.9M).
